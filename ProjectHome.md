The OCLC SRW/SRU Open Source project offers software that implements both the SRW Web Service and the SRU REST model interface to databases. Parallel projects include support for DSpace, Lucene, OCLC's Pears and Newton databases and a Federated Searching framework.

General information about SRW/SRU can be found on the [WikiHomePage](WikiHomePage.md)

Documentation for installation and operation of the SRW/SRU server can be found on the [InstallationInstructions](InstallationInstructions.md) page

Documentation about configuration files for the SRW/SRU server can be found on the [ConfigurationFiles](ConfigurationFiles.md) page

[URLConstruction](URLConstruction.md) page

Documentation on how I'm using my SRU server to deliver up Linked Data can be found on the [LinkedData](LinkedData.md) page

I gave a talk on the Linked Data framework at Access 2010 in Winnipeg.  My notes are here: [Access2010Talk](Access2010Talk.md)

Documentation on how to define local SRU parameters, how to access those parameters in your code and how to set extraResponseData: [SRUInputParameterExtensions](SRUInputParameterExtensions.md)

We support persistent URIs in an environment where URIs come and go all the time.  A description of how we do that using Merged databases can be found at [PersistentURIPattern](PersistentURIPattern.md)
